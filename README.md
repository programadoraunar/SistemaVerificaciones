## Deploy to Vercel

Vercel deployment will guide you through creating a Supabase account and project.

The above will also clone the Starter kit to your GitHub, you can clone that locally and develop locally.

If you wish to just develop locally and not deploy to Vercel, [follow the steps below](#clone-and-run-locally).

The deployment was done in Vercel, from there the deployment of the application and everything related to the hosting of the project is managed.
